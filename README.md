## banana jump
collect as many bananas as you can while avoiding the hard-to-spot rocks!

basically, my first godot game. i learnt a bunch of stuff about scenes, layers, and hosting games. pretty simple but i had a fun time (~7 hrs!) making it. plus, it's got a parallax background! that's a win.
### coming up:
there are lots of improvements and features that need to be added for sure! (including more obstacles, time limit, and the very important theme music + sounds!)
